# SVM and K-Nearest Neighbor implementations

* **Gheata_H1P1_IBL** Implementation of the SVM algorithm. 
* **Gheata_H1P2_IBL** Implementation of the SVM algorithm with custom kernel. 
* **Gheata_H1P3_IBL** Finding the best parameters for the SVM model using the `scikit`. `cross-validation` of the model.
* **Gheata_H1P3_IBL** Finding the best parameters for the K-Nearest Neighbor model using the `scikit`. `cross-validation` of the model.

The problem requirements can be found in `handout1_ibl_corrected.pdf` and the data in the `datasets-ibl` folder. Credits to the University of the 
Balearic Island for providing the problems and datasets.
